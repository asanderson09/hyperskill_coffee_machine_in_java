/**
 * Residents of the country of Malevia often experiment with the plan of their rooms. Rooms can be triangular,
 * rectangular, and round. To quickly calculate the floorage it is required to write a program that gets the type
 * of the room shape and the relevant parameters as input. The program should output the area of the resulting room.
 * <p>
 * The value of 3.14 is used instead of the number Ï€ in Malevia.
