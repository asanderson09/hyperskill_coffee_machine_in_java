/**
 * A bus tour of Europe has been very successful. Due to an increase in the number of people that want to go on a tour,
 * the tour company decided to increase the height of the bus. The new height of the bus is exactly N centimeters.
 * <p>
 * But the tourâ€™s route runs under a lot of bridges, and there is a chance that the bus will crash into one of these
 * bridges. Can you find out if this will happen?
 * <p>
 * The first line of the input contains the height of the bus and number of bridges under which the bus passes.
 * The second line contains heights of these bridges.
 * <p>
 * You should output "Will not crash" if everything will be all right; otherwise, output "Will crash on bridge i"
 * (where i is a number of a bridge) into which the bus will crash. If the height of a bridge equals the height of the
 * bus, the bus will crash.
