/**
 * A real coffee machine never has an infinite supply of water, milk, or coffee beans. And if you input a really big
 * number, itâ€™s almost certain that a real coffee machine wouldn't have the supplies needed to make all that coffee.
 * <p>
 * In this stage, you need to improve the previous program. Now you need to input amounts of water, milk, and coffee
 * beans that your coffee machine has at the moment.
 * <p>
 * If the coffee machine has enough supplies to make the specified amount of coffee, the program should print
 * "Yes, I can make that amount of coffee". If the coffee machine can make more than that, the program should output
 * "Yes, I can make that amount of coffee (and even N more than that)", where N is the number of additional cups of
 * coffee that the coffee machine can make. If the amount of resources is not enough to make the specified amount of
 * coffee, the program should output "No, I can make only N cup(s) of coffee".
